## My story

#### From building walls to building algorithms, I’ve always been driven by a passion for creating and problem-solving.

In high school, I followed a builder profile, which gave me practical skills and a mindset focused on making, fixing, and improving things. At the same time, my curiosity for technology was growing outside of school — mostly while playing video games and modifying them to improve my own gameplay. Installing mods often meant tinkering with bits of code in languages I didn’t even recognize back then. Later, I also started writing small scripts for bots — simple apps that could play parts of the game for me. Those experiments sparked a fascination with how code could automate tasks and create new possibilities.

After graduation, life took me in a different direction. I spent almost nine years working in various industries, gaining experience in teamwork, responsibility, and solving problems in hands-on environments.

Eventually, I wanted to try something new — and I reminded myself of the excitement I felt when “coding for fun.” That decision led me back to education, this time in a completely new field: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Today, I’m combining my practical background with modern technical skills, eager to keep learning and building solutions that make a real impact.

Beyond academics and work, I’ve always been passionate about sports. Over the years I’ve practiced many disciplines — from running and soccer to gym and fitness — and I still stay active. Sports keep me motivated, disciplined, and remind me that progress comes step by step, just like in learning and coding.
